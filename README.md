# Implementation of a database for an adoptionâ€™s association 
The project involves the development of a database, from its structuring to its implementation, and its accessibility to even inexperienced users through a graphical interface. The project involved interviewing the requesting association, creating an ER diagram to design the database, implementing the database on MySQL, populating it with company data, and testing its efficiency. A graphical interface using Python was also drafted to enhance consumer accessibility and interactivity, allowing for easy data insertion, modification, updating, or deletion.
